Part 1 improvements
I got rid of errors that were previously in my part one which was very buggy and did not run well. I have also improved the classes i created for the program to run smoothly.
I created a github repository which i did not have in part 1. i also improve the formate of the code to match international coding standereds. I created a README fcile and a link to my
repository.
